# MNIST Digit Classification using ANN

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the development and training of an ANN to achieve accurate predictions on the dataset.

## Features:
- **Dataset:** Uses the MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).
- **Model Architecture:** A fully connected feed-forward neural network with customizable layers and activation functions.
- **Training:** Implements model training using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or other optimizers.
- **Evaluation:** Model evaluation based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss/accuracy curves.
- **Preprocessing:** Normalizes input data and optionally applies techniques such as dropout and weight regularization.
- **Hyperparameters:** Easily adjustable learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/whatizee/MNIST_ANN_Prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the ANN on the MNIST dataset.
